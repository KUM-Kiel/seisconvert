      <h1>Seisconvert</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Seisconvert library is a library for handling of several seismic data formats.
        It supports KUM-Y, MiniSEED, SEG-Y and WAV.
      </p>
      <h2>Compiling</h2>
      <p>
        Just do
        <span class="codeblock">$ make</span>
        in the main directory.
        This will build the libraries and the utility programs.
      </p>
      <h2>Components</h2>
      <h3>MiniSEED</h3>
      <p>
        The API for MiniSEED is based on the header file “miniseed_file.h”.
        All the functions of this module handle with the type “miniseed_file_t”, which represents an open MiniSEED file.
      </p>
      <h4>Reading</h4>
      <p>
        A file can be opened with
        <span class="codeblock">miniseed_file_open(const char *filename)</span>
        This will return a miniseed_file_t ready for reading or NULL on error.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now one can repeatedly call either
        <span class="codeblock">miniseed_file_read_int_frame(miniseed_file_t *file, int32_t *frame)</span>
        or
        <span class="codeblock">miniseed_file_read_double_frame(miniseed_file_t *file, double *frame)</span>
        until a negative value is returned.
        This will read one sample from the file in each call and stores it to the frame pointer.
        The int variant of this function stores a 32 bit integer, the double variant stores a normalised double, i.&#8239;e. 1.0 as double is the same as 0x7f&#8239;ff&#8239;ff&#8239;ff as integer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The read functions return 0 if a sample was read, –1 if there was no more data and –3 in case of an error.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you are done with reading, the file must be closed with
        <span class="codeblock">miniseed_file_close(miniseed_file_t *file)</span>
      </p>
      <h4>Writing</h4>
      <p>
        If the file should instead be opened for writing, one may call
        <span class="codeblock">miniseed_file_create(const char *filename)</span>
        This will return a file in write mode or NULL in case of an error.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a file has been opened in write mode, the sample rate must be set before any data can be written.
        This is done by calling
        <span class="codeblock">miniseed_file_set_sample_rate(miniseed_file_t *file, uint32_t sample_rate)</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        The start time must be set as well, i.&#8239;e. the time, when the recording was started.
        This is done with
        <span class="codeblock">miniseed_file_set_start_time(miniseed_file_t *file, struct taia *t)</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        After initialisation, one can optionally set the channel metadata with
        <span class="codeblock">miniseed_file_set_info(miniseed_file_t *file, const char *station, const char *location, const char *channel, const char *network)</span>
        The fields may be NULL, in which case the specific info remains unchanged.
      </p>
      <p>
        When all fields have been set, one can start writing samples to the file.
        This is done with the functions
        <span class="codeblock">miniseed_file_write_int_frame(miniseed_file_t *file, const int32_t *frame)</span>
        and
        <span class="codeblock">miniseed_file_write_double_frame(miniseed_file_t *file, const double *frame)</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        When you are done with writing, the file must be closed with
        <span class="codeblock">miniseed_file_close(miniseed_file_t *file)</span>
        This is especially important, as the last block will not be written to disk until this function is called.
      </p>
      <h4>Example</h4>
      <p>
        <span class="codeblock">#include &quot;miniseed_file.h&quot;

int main()
{
  miniseed_file_t *file;
  int32_t frame[1];

  file = miniseed_file_open("testfile.seed");
  while (miniseed_file_read_int_frame(file, frame) >= 0) {
    /* Do something with frame[0] ... */
  }
  miniseed_file_close(file);

  return 0;
}</span>
      </p>
      <h3>WAV</h3>
      <p>
        The API for WAV is based on the header file “wav_file.h”.
        All the functions of this module handle with the type “wav_file_t”, which represents an open WAV file.
      </p>
      <h4>Reading</h4>
      <p>
        A file can be opened with
        <span class="codeblock">wav_file_t *wav_file_open(const char *path);</span>
        This will return a wav_file_t ready for reading or NULL on error.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several functions to access the parameters of the file.
        <span class="codeblock">uint32_t wav_file_sample_rate(wav_file_t *file);
uint16_t wav_file_num_channels(wav_file_t *file);
uint16_t wav_file_bit_depth(wav_file_t *file);
uint16_t wav_file_num_frames(wav_file_t *file);
uint32_t wav_file_position(wav_file_t *file);</span>
        They return the sample rate, the number of channels, the bit depth, the total number of frames in the file and the current position.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now one can repeatedly call one of
        <span class="codeblock">int wav_file_read_int_frame(wav_file_t *file, int32_t *frame);
int wav_file_read_double_frame(wav_file_t *file, double *frame);
int wav_file_read_float_frame(wav_file_t *file, float *frame);</span>
        until a negative value is returned.
        This will read one frame from the file, i.&#8239;e. one sample for each channel, in each call and stores it to the frame pointer.
        There must be enough space to hold one value for every channel.
        The int variant of this function reads a 32 bit integer, the float and double variants read a normalised float or double.
      </p>
      <p>
        The read functions return 0 if a frame was read, –1 if there was no more data and –3 in case of an error.
      </p>
      <p>
        While reading the file, you can seek to a position in the file by calling
        <span class="codeblock">int wav_file_seek(const char *path, uint32_t frame);</span>
        This will make subsequent read calls read from this position.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you are done with reading, the file must be closed with
        <span class="codeblock">void wav_file_close(wav_file_t *file);</span>
      </p>
      <h4>Writing</h4>
      <p>
        If the file should instead be opened for writing, one may call
        <span class="codeblock">wav_file_t *wav_file_create(const char *path, uint32_t sample_rate, uint16_t num_channels, uint16_t bit_depth);</span>
        This will return a file in write mode or NULL in case of an error.
        The sample rate, number of channels and bit depth must be specified in the call.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the file is created, one can start writing frames to the file.
        This is done with the functions
        <span class="codeblock">int wav_file_write_int_frame(wav_file_t *file, const int32_t *frame);
int wav_file_write_double_frame(wav_file_t *file, const double *frame);
int wav_file_write_float_frame(wav_file_t *file, const float *frame);</span>
        Each frame must have one value per channel.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you are done with writing, the file again must be closed with
        <span class="codeblock">void wav_file_close(wav_file_t *file);</span>
        This is especially important, as the number of frames will not be written to disk until this function is called.
      </p>
      <h4>Example</h4>
      <p>
        This example program converts a WAV file with up to 16 channels to 8 bit.
        <span class="codeblock">#include &quot;wav_file.h&quot;

int main()
{
  wav_file_t *in, *out;
  double frame[16];
  uint16_t c;

  in = wav_file_open("in.wav");
  if ((c = wav_file_num_channels(in)) > 16) return -1;
  out = wav_file_create("out.wav", wav_file_sample_rate(in), c, 8);
  while (wav_file_read_double_frame(in, frame) >= 0) {
    wav_file_write_double_frame(out, frame);
  }
  wav_file_close(in);
  wav_file_close(out);

  return 0;
}</span>
